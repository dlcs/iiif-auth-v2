# IIIF Auth 2

IIIF Auth v2 handles [IIIF Authorization Flow API 2.0](https://iiif.io/api/auth/2.0/) requests and is an implmementation of [DLCS RFC 012](https://github.com/dlcs/protagonist/blob/main/docs/rfcs/012-auth-service.md)

## Role Provider Types

The following role provider types are supported, this will be extended over time:

* `clickthrough` - auth service will render agreement, on accepting the user is granted specified roles. Not external dependencies.
* `oidc` - external authorization server is used for login, claims are mapped to DLCS roles, see [DLCS RFC 008](https://github.com/dlcs/protagonist/blob/main/docs/rfcs/008-more-access-control-oidc-oauth.md)

## Running

There is a Dockerfile and docker-compose file for running app:

```bash
# build docker image
docker build -t iiif-auth-2:local .  

# run image
docker run -it --rm \
    --name iiif-auth-2 \
    -p "8014:80" \
    iiif-auth-2:local

# run via docker-compose
docker compose up
```

For local debugging there are 2 docker compose files available:
* `docker-compose.db.yml` - runs an empty postgres instance. Running sln with `RunMigrations=true` will scaffold DB.
* `docker-compose.local.yml` - runs the above and also an nginx container, which is:
  * Running on `https://localhost:5040`.
  * Proxying `/auth/v2/probe/*` and `/*` to localhost:5013. This is the http port for Orchestrator as defined in `launchSettings.json`
  * Proxying `/auth/v2/*` to localhost:7149. This is the http port for iiif-auth-v2, as defined in `launchSettings.json`

```bash
# run postgres DB only
$ docker compose -f docker-compose.db.yml up

# run postgres DB and nginx proxy
$ docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up
```

> [!WARNING]
> That nginx container uses a self-signed cert. This will show browser errors but is enough for local testing.

## Configuration

The following appSetting configuration values are supported:

> A note on Dictionarys for domain-specific paths. A key of `"Default"` serves as fallback but isn't necessary if the default value matches the canonical DLCS path.

## Migrations

Migrations can be added by running the following:

```bash
cd src/IIIFAuth2

dotnet ef migrations add "{migration-name}" -p IIIFAuth2.API -o Data/Migrations
```

Migrations are applied on startup, regardless of environment, if `"RunMigrations" = "true"`.

## Local Development

This service is an extension of [DLCS Protagonist](https://github.com/dlcs/protagonist/) and when deployed will run under the same host as the main DLCS, with routing rules controlled at load-balancer level.

Below are steps for running iiif-auth-v2 and Orchestrator locally:

1. Run `docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up`
2. In iiif-auth-v2 set `"OrchestratorRoot": "https://localhost:5040"` appSetting (nginx port)
3. In orchestrator set `"Auth__Auth2ServiceRoot": "https://localhost:7049/auth/v2/"` appSetting (default from auth-services launchSettings)
